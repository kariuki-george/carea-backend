# Carea-Backend

Carea-Backend is the backend for a car-selling platform.

## Functionalities:

1. User Auth
2. User Roles

## Architecture

The project is built on a monolith with the above functionalities separated in modules.

This allows for single responsibilities and higher cohesion of the modules.

The project uses the following technologies:

1. Nestjs

   1. The opinionated structuring of code into modules allows for good dev experience as well as cleaner code.
   2. The dependency injection allows for cleaner code.

2. Postgres

   1. The data used are highly related to each other thus a relational database is preferred.

3. Prisma

   1. The type-safety, declarative schema file, and good migration support made prisma the perfect choice the Orm.

4. Kafka

   1. Kafka is used to offer asynchronous processing of events as well as background processing of tasks such as sending emails.

5. Redis\*

   1. Redis is used as a cache to complement the databaseâ€™s performance.

6. Docker

   1. Used for deployment.

7. Graphql

   1. Preferred over rest because of the good dev experience, type-safety.
